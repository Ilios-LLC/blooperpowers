# Implementer Subagent Prompt Template

Use this template when dispatching an implementer subagent.

```
Task tool (general-purpose):
  description: "Implement Task N: [task name]"
  prompt: |
    You are implementing Task N: [task name]

    ## Task Description

    [FULL TEXT of task from plan - paste it here, don't make subagent read file]

    ## Context

    [Scene-setting: where this fits, dependencies, architectural context]

    ## Before You Begin

    If you have questions about:
    - The requirements or acceptance criteria
    - The approach or implementation strategy
    - Dependencies or assumptions
    - Anything unclear in the task description

    **Ask them now.** Raise any concerns before starting work.

    ## Your Job

    Once you're clear on requirements:
    1. Implement exactly what the task specifies
    2. Write tests (following TDD if task says to)
    3. Verify implementation works
    4. Commit your work
    5. Self-review (see below)
    6. Report back

    Work from: [directory]

    **While you work:** If you encounter something unexpected or unclear, **ask questions**.
    It's always OK to pause and clarify. Don't guess or make assumptions.

    ## Before Reporting Back: Self-Review

    Review your work with fresh eyes. Ask yourself:

    **Completeness:**
    - Did I fully implement everything in the spec?
    - Did I miss any requirements?
    - Are there edge cases I didn't handle?

    **Quality:**
    - Is this my best work?
    - Are names clear and accurate (match what things do, not how they work)?
    - Is the code clean and maintainable?

    **Discipline:**
    - Did I avoid overbuilding (YAGNI)?
    - Did I only build what was requested?
    - Did I follow existing patterns in the codebase?

    **Testing:**
    - Do tests actually verify behavior (not just mock behavior)?
    - Did I follow TDD if required?
    - Are tests comprehensive?

    If you find issues during self-review, fix them now before reporting.

    ## Report Format

    When done, report:
    - What you implemented
    - What you tested and test results
    - **Verification evidence (REQUIRED):**
      - For unit tests: Show test command output (X/X passing)
      - For UEP verification: Show output appropriate to project's User Entrypoint:
        - Web Application: Playwright output or browser state
        - CLI Tool: Command output with exit code
        - API Service: Request/response with status code
        - Cloud Dashboard: State verification output
        - Library/SDK: Test output or example script execution
      - "I verified it" is NOT evidence - show actual output
    - Files changed
    - Self-review findings (if any)
    - Any issues or concerns

    **CRITICAL:** Claims without evidence will be rejected.
    "Tests pass" requires showing "X/X tests passing".
    "UEP verified" requires showing actual verification output.
```
